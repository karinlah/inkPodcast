From New York Times unlikable While this today Glane Maxwell's years long relationship with Jeffrey Epstein has raised questions about what she may have known about allegations of sex trafficking against it now.
Thousands of pages of sealed document stemming from their release are about to be made public.
It's Friday, July twenty six.
Megan to it. Tell us about Delaine Maxwell. So she is the daughter. She's one of nine children born Teo, a British media mogul named Robert Maxwell.
She grew up in like a fifty room mansion in England. Her father sailed a boat called the Lady Elaine, presumably an indication that she was maybe one of his favorites. And so she came up from being shoulders with kind of aristocrats and royalty and really lead a rich and charmed life in England and then in the early nineties came to New York, and the timing was remarkable that same year in nineteen ninety
One. Her father tumbled off that boat to his death amidst and mounting debt, and later that year, it was revealed that he had also basically pillaged the pensions of his employees. So she was basically getting a start in New York as her family fortune was disappearing, and her family's name was in ruins. And right around that time she needs Jeffrey Epstein.
It's not clear exactly when their relationship may be shifted from being romantic. Not being romantic. But what happened is as thie allegations against Epstein started to surface in the mid to thousands. There were also allegations that emerged against Maxwell reporting on her that I did with my colleague Jacob Bernstein. We found that one of the friends who socialized who attended their dinner party
He's said that Maxwell seemed to be half ex girlfriend, half employee half best friend and fixer, but you also have a couple of Epstein's accusers use much different language to describe her roll. One of them has described her as
His madam, which is a way of saying that she was in charge of arranging sexual interactions cracked
So in Epstein's homes, there were massage tables everywhere and he had what has been described as an insatiable appetite for massage is one of the former employees in the Palm Beach mansion, described as many as two hundred misuses being recruited into the home over a several year period and said that Maxwell was
Oftentimes in charge of that recruitment and very active. Those massages were in some cases cover for a vehicle for the sexual abuse and exploitation of underage girls. And so you've also had a couple of scenes Accusers say that they were actually solicited by Maxwell.
And that in a couple cases she participated in the sexual abuse herself. So to the degree that there was a kind of trafficking going on, she was deeply involved. According to several of absence accusers. Yeah, they say that she was in some ways central to the sexual trafficking of girls and young women.
So what happens to this relationship overtime, So this relationship as we understand it carries on for years and years until two thousand eight, which is a very significant year and the Epstein story because that's the year at which he pleads guilty to soliciting a prostitute as part of this extraordinary nonprosecution agreement that he strikes with federal authorities. This was a significant turning point, because another thing that happened is part of that nonprosecution agreement is that Epstein's
Alleged victims, even though they hadn't been able Tio see him criminally prosecuted for the alleged crimes that they committed against these. Many women have any girls who were surfacing at the time. They were given the green light to move forward with civil cases against him, and that became this whole other track by which allegation started to surface. And so in two thousand nine, one of Epstein's accusers files a lawsuit. These were called Jane Doe suits in which
The young women were given assigned attorneys who then represented them in civil cases that were quickly struck in which Epstein made financial payments to them, and the names were shield. They were called. The names were shielded. In many cases. There's minimal records from these cases now, But these were the cases in which some of these additional allegations started to come out so as early as two thousand nine, one of the obscene accusers who sued
Epstein, in one of these Jane Doe cases, made her allegations against Maxwell and said that she had been recruited by Maxwell and that you know, she had basically forced her into sexual activity with Epstein. So is earliest two thousand nine, Maxwell becomes part of the public record of allegations and Maxwell and
Epstein go separate ways and so they're not visibly attached anymore. But once Epstein finishes serving his fifteen month jail sentence in Florida, you know he comes back to New York continues to be very visible here in New York society, and Maxwell continues to be very visible kind of in high society. She's being photographed on the party circuit. She's you know, forming other high profile alliances and affiliations. She had been friendly with the Clintons.
She attends Chelsea Clinton's wedding She attends Clinton Global Initiative events When I was a little girl, I grew up watching Jack Christo on TV, and I was mesmerized by the beauty of the ocean and the colorful a magnetic fish that I saw on TV. She has taken up the environmental cause. Presenting herself is a friend of the ocean.
The ocean is absolutely vital. Total planetary life systems. I call it the blue heart of the planet.
She gives a talk and a Ted event. And so she and obscene They're both continuing Tio by many measures kind of carry on in many ways unscathed by what's happened.
That starts to change a little bit for her after two thousand fifteen.
